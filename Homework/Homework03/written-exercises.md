A bounded buffer would be the most appropriate class to use for this holding area because every time the producer has a new value prepared, it will store the value into an immediate storage area called the buffer. Whenever the consumer is ready to take in the next value, it'll do so by getting it from the buffer. This allows the process to be as efficient as possible without adding unnecessary processing time.
